## Purpose

This web application is useful for creating quick notes available on a web browser.

This is a MERN application (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) which not only creates notes, but is capable of storing them in a database.

The web application can be viewed on the [leaf-note](https://leaf-note.herokuapp.com/) webpage.

## How to Use the Application

1. Navigate to the main page and click inside the text box where it says "Write a note"
2. The box will open providing you with a place to write a quick note with a title and content.
3. Click the "+" button when you are satisfied with your current note.
4. The note will be added to the page.
5. To delete the note, simply click the trash can button available on each created note.

## Demonstration

Below is a basic demo useful for using the website. Information is typed and added to a collection of notes and then saved to a database.
